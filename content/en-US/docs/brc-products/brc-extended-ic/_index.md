## Overview

**BRC Extended IC is a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central app that provides improved system support for intercompany flows.** Based on orders from your end customers, sales orders are created in your operating company, and if the order should be sent from a warehouse that is also a company within your intercompany flow, the sales order is then created in the warehouse company as well. The order is then sent directly to the end customer from the warehouse company and is updated as shipped in the operating company, which can then invoice the end customer. 

Master data functionality is included and is a prerequisite for updating and sharing related data between companies such as items, price lists, and other data registers. With master data functionality, it becomes easy to keep all companies' data configurations in sync to then be able to run the BRC Extended IC flow.

**Key Features in BRC Extended IC:**
- Sales orders are created and released automatically both in the operating company and in the warehouse company
- Delivery in the warehouse company triggers delivery and invoice in the operating company  
- Sales return orders are created automatically and released in the warehouse company if they are first created in the operating company
- Goods that first arrive at the warehouse can automatically be created as a sales return order in the warehouse company

**Benefits of BRC Extended IC:**
- Quick and simplified way to configure settings in Business Central
- Automatically handle large volumes of transactions
